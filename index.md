## Mission and Services

The High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) provides state-of-the-art research
computing infrastructure and training accessible to all UCR researchers and affiliates
at low cost. This includes access to the shared HPC resources and services summarized below.
The main advantage of a shared research computing environment is access to a much larger HPC
infrastructure (with thousands of CPUs/GPUs and many PBs of directly attached
storage) than what smaller clusters of individual research groups could afford,
while also providing a long-term sustainability plan and professional systems
administrative support.

## <span style="color:red"> HPCC Operation During COVID-19 Crisis </span>

Since the research computing infrastructure of the HPCC is designed to be
accessed remotely, we are currently not expecting any major downtimes or
restrictions for users due to the campus access restrictions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, even this may change depending on the extent of the
restrictions our university may have to implement. A few exceptions that are
currently in effect for the HPCC facility are the following: 

  + Our offices in 1208/1207 Genomics Building are closed. The HPCC staff will continue to work as usual but exclusively via remote access from home. 
  + All in person contacts such as office visits or in-person training events are not possible during the current COVID-19 crisis. Alternatively, we will be offering remote training sessions via video conferencing using Zoom. 

If users need to get in contact with us then please email your questions to [support@hpcc.ucr.edu](mailto:support@hpcc.ucr.edu). For immediate help, users can also post questions on Slack ([ucr-hpcc.slack.com](https://ucr-hpcc.slack.com)). For latest news and updates, please also visit us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCR_HPCC). With some delay, updates will also be posted on this website's [News](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/news.html) and [Alerts](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/alerts.html) pages.

access to high-performance compute resources, data analysis and programming expertise.
The resources serve scientists at UC Riverside to master the bigdata and informatics needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner. 
The following services are offered:

  * Development and maintenance of a high-performance informatics hardware and software infrastructure for our research community at UCR.
  * Instruction of hands-on tutorials and workshops on cluster usage. Extensive manuals for these tutorials are available on our manual page.
  * Establishment of research collaborations with experimental scientists from different departments.


## Facility Description

Our high-performance computing infrastructure is located in the Genomics Cluster Farm.
It provides access to enterprise level high-performance computing resources, for data analysis and programming.
These resources serve the scientists at UC Riverside, and elsewhere, to master big compute and big data needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner.
We also host a broad range of free workshops on proper cluster utilization that provides a strong training component to successful grants.
