## Mission and Services

The High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) provides technical expertise and
training in HPC, as well as access to state-of-the-art research computing
infrastructure accessible to all UCR researchers at low cost. This includes
access to the following shared HPC resources and services. The main advantage
of a shared research computing infrastructure is that is allows to build a
much larger HPC infrastructure (with thousands of CPUs/GPUs and many PBs of directly
attached storage) than what smaller clusters of individual research groups
could afford including a long-term sustainability plan and systems
administrative expertise. 

## HPC hardware
    
* Multipurpose cluster optimized for parallel, non-parallel and big data computing 
* Petabyte storage system for high-availability data directly attached to computing infrastructure
* Supported access models

    * Annual subscription fee for user accounts and CPU access (no extra charge for CPU usage)
    * Rental options for data storage
    * Ownership options for both computer nodes and data storage

## Software
    
* Access to >1000 software tools, packages and community databases
* Custom software installs by emailing ticket system @ [support@biocluster.ucr.edu](mailto:support@biocluster.ucr.edu)

## Training

* HPC usage
* Small, medium and big data processing

## Cloud and national HPC facilities 
    
* To be deployed in late 2017
   
   * Support for using commercial cloud computing resources and national HPC facilities

access to high-performance compute resources, data analysis and programming expertise.
The resources serve scientists at UC Riverside to master the bigdata and informatics needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner. 
The following services are offered:

  * Development and maintenance of a high-performance informatics hardware and software infrastructure for our research community at UCR.
  * Instruction of hands-on tutorials and workshops on cluster usage. Extensive manuals for these tutorials are available on our manual page.
  * Establishment of research collaborations with experimental scientists from different departments.


## Facility Description

Our high-performance computing infrastructure is located in the Genomics Cluster Farm.
It provides access to enterprise level high-performance computing resources, for data analysis and programming.
These resources serve the scientists at UC Riverside, and elsewhere, to master big compute and big data needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner.
We also host a broad range of free workshops on proper cluster utilization that provides a strong training component to successful grants.

  * Software Resources: [System](software_system) and [Modules](software_modules)

## Rates

Annual User Registration Fee

The annual registration fee of $1,000 gives all members of an UCR lab access to our high-performance computing infrastructure.
The registration provides access to the following resources: 

  * Over 4500 CPU cores, ~2PB disk space, 512GB-1TB of memory/node, etc. More details are available on the compute hardware page.
  * Over 800 software packages and all common research databases. More details are available on the software page.
  * Free attendance of all our workshops
  * Free consultation services (up to 1 hour per month).
