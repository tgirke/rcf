## Storage
* Four enterprise class HPC storage systems
* Approximately 2 PB (2048 TB) of network storage
* GPFS (NFS and SAMBA via GPFS)
* Automatic snapshots and archival backups

## Network
* Ethernet
    * 5 x 1 Gb/s switch
    * 5 x 1 Gb/s switch 10 Gig uplink
    * 1 x 10 Gb/s switch for campus-wide science DMZ
    * Redundant, load balanced, robust mesh topology
* Interconnect
    * 56 Gb/s InfiniBand (FDR)

## Head Nodes
All users should access the cluster via SSH through `cluster.hpcc.ucr.edu`. This address will automatically balance traffic to one of the available head nodes.
