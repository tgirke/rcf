## Past exceptions 

### 12:00 AM, 31-Jan-18: routine maintenance shutdown

For routine maintenance and upgrades we have scheduled an HPCC (Biocluster)
shutdown for 12:00AM, Jan-31-2018 to 12:00AM, Feb-01-2018. (complete) 

### 12:00 AM, 05-Dec-17: NFS & SMB issues

NFS and SMB services have been suspended temporarily.
This will cause many of our web services to not function properly.
These include, but not limited to:
  * https://rstudio.bioinfo.ucr.edu & https://rstudio2.bioinfo.ucr.edu
  * https://galaxy.bioinfo.ucr.edu
  * https://dashboard.bioinfo.ucr.edu
  * https://biocluster.ucr.edu/~username (.html directories)
  * mysql://bioclusterdb.int.bioinfo.ucr.edu (databases)

Note, this issue was resolved soon after it occurred. 

### 11:00 AM, 13-Aug-17: Cooling problem

Since Sat morning one of the HVAC units is not working properly. To avoid overheating, 
we have shut down most of the idle nodes (1:30PM, Sun). As soon as the HVAC unit 
is repaired we will power these nodes back on. Note, this issue was resolved on 17-Aug-17.
UCR facility services has repaired the broken HVAC unit and serviced the second one. 

### 12:00 AM, 16-Jun-17 to 17-Jun-17: maintenance shutdown

To sustain future growth, the power load in the HPCC server room needs to be
optimized. For this we have scheduled an HPCC (Biocluster) shutdown in four
weeks from now which will start at noon on June 16th and last until noon June 17th. This
will require a shutdown of ALL services: Slurm (queuing system), hosted
websites, virtual environments/machines, storage access, backup systems and
network services. We ask that you please make sure that you do not have any
jobs running in the queue, and that you completely logout of the cluster
(pigeon, owl, penguin, pelican, globus) before the shutdown. 

### 10:02 AM, 13-Apr-17: UPS failure

Our UPS unit went down some time last night causing a power failure on all systems. Jordan is bypassing the UPS to bring things back up in the next
few hours. Nationwide Power will come in asap to repair the UPS. Note, this failure has not resulted in any overheating problems since the AC units
are running on a different power cricuit.

### 11:22 AM, 13-Apr-17: Cluster back up running

Situation is resolved for now and things are working. We are currently discussing the situation with our electricians to avoid future instances.
