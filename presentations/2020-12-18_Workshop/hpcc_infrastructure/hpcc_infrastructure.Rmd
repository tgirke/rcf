## Mission of HPCC {.flexbox .vcenter}

- Campus-wide research high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure
- Partners with other IT/HPC units at UCR and UC system
- Training in HPC, big data processing and cloud computing

## Hardware Infrastructure

## Software {.smaller}

- Large stack of __thousands__ of free and/or open-source __software tools__ and packages managed via __module system__
- Facility installs new software upon user requests on a daily basis 
- Users can __install software themselves__ manually or via package manager and environment management systems such as Conda, CRAN/Bioc, etc.
- Web-based environments: Jupyter Hub and RStudio Server
- Commercial tools only where necessary:
     <span style="font-size: 14px;">
     - GPFS for parallel storage system
     - Gaussian
     - MATLAB (to use ask to be added to license!)
     - Intel Parallel Suite
     - SAS and Stata
     </span>
- Additional commercial software can be installed if funding for license is available

## Organization and Management of HPCC

- Part of UCR-wide Office of Research and Economic Development (RED) 
- Staff
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">
    - Faculty director (Thomas Girke)
    - 2 HPC systems administrators (Jordan Hayes & new member)
    - Student HPC/Linux admin assistants (Melody Asghari, Abraham Park, _et al._)
  </span>
- Faculty advisory board
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">
    - Faculty and staff members with hands-on HPC experience ([current member list](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/members.html))
  </span>
- Modular funding model
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">
    - Recharging and ownership options 
    - Grant funding
        - Equipment grants (_e.g._ NSF-MRI and NIH-S10) 
        - Research grants (many agencies and programs)
    - UCR contribution 
  </span>

## Recharging and Quotas

- Subscription fee
   - Subscription based access model: $1000 per lab/yr
   - Big data storage:
      - GB plan: $25/yr for 100GB (usable and backed up space)
      - TB plan: $1000/yr for 10TB (usable and backed-up space)
   - Ownership models: see next slide
- Quota
   - Maximum CPU core usage limited to 512 CPU cores per lab and 256 CPU cores per user per partition
   - No charge for CPU hours!!!
   - RAM quotas are queue specific 
- Details about recharging rates: see [here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/docs.html)

## Ownership Options

Ownership models for computer nodes and data storage. Attractive to labs that need 24/7 access to hundreds of CPU cores and more than 30TB storage.

### Storage
- Purchase hard drives @ current market price that will be added to GPFS storage
- Annual maintenance fee ¼ of rental price
- Often more cost effective for storage needs ≥30TB 

### Computer nodes
- Purchase nodes at current market price with compatible network cards
- Administered under a priority queueing system via private queue for owners; also increases overall CPU quota by the number of owned CPU cores.
