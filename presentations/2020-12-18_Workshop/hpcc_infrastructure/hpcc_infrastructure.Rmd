    - 2 HPC systems administrators (Jordan Hayes & new member)
    - Student HPC/Linux admin assistants (Melody Asghari, Abraham Park, _et al._)
  </span>
- Faculty advisory board
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">
    - Faculty and staff members with hands-on HPC experience ([current member list](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/members.html))
  </span>
- Modular funding model
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">
    - Recharging and ownership options 
    - Grant funding
        - Equipment grants (_e.g._ NSF-MRI and NIH-S10) 
        - Research grants (many agencies and programs)
    - UCR contribution 
  </span>

## Recharging and Quotas

- Subscription fee
   - Subscription based access model: $1000 per lab/yr
   - Big data storage:
      - GB plan: $25/yr for 100GB (usable and backed up space)
      - TB plan: $1000/yr for 10TB (usable and backed-up space)
   - Ownership models: see next slide
- Quota
   - Maximum CPU core usage limited to 512 CPU cores per lab and 256 CPU cores per user per partition
   - No charge for CPU hours!!!
   - RAM quotas are queue specific 
- Details about recharging rates: see [here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/docs.html)

## Ownership Options

Ownership models for computer nodes and data storage. Attractive to labs that need 24/7 access to hundreds of CPU cores and more than 30TB storage.

### Storage
- Purchase hard drives @ current market price that will be added to GPFS storage
- Annual maintenance fee ¼ of rental price
- Often more cost effective for storage needs ≥30TB 

### Computer nodes
- Purchase nodes at current market price with compatible network cards
- Administered under a priority queueing system via private queue for owners; also increases overall CPU quota by the number of owned CPU cores.
