## Overview

In Linux (and Unix systems in general), access to files and directories is
controlled by a system of owners, groups, and permission bits. Changing these
settings is necessary to control access by other users.
The permission system also affects what files can be executed.

## Ownership Levels

* **user (u)** - User ownership of a file/directory. This user has the special
right to change the permission bits and group ownership.
* **group (g)** - Group ownership of a file/directory. Members of this group may
be assigned greater access rights than non-members.
* **other (o)** - Everyone else that isn't the owning user or from the owning
group.

## Permission Bits

The elemental permissions in Linux/Unix are read, write, and execute. Users and
groups can have one many, or none of these rights. Their meanings are as follows:

|   | Letter | Number | File | Directory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read | r | 4 | View the contents | View the listings |
| Write | w | 2 | Modify the contents | Create a new file, or rename or delete existing files |
| Execute | x | 1 | Execute a program/script | Traversal rights |

Assign write and execute permissions to user and group

`chmod ug+rx my_file`

To remove all permissions from all three user groups

```bash
chmod ugo-rwx my_file
            # '+' causes the permissions selected to be added
            # '-' causes them to be removed
            # '=' causes them to be the only permissions that the file has.

chmod +rx public_html/ or $ chmod 755 public_html/ # Example for number system:
```

## Change ownership

```bash
chown <user> <file or dir>         # changes user ownership
chgrp <group> <file or dir>        # changes group ownership
chown <user>:<group> <file or dir> # changes user & group ownership
```
