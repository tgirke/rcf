## Learn how to establish an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account under the UC Agreement.

A UC-wide agreement for Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been established. The agreement provides **Data Egress Fee waiver for up to 15% of total monthly AWS fees**.

    * Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
  * 80%+ of data egress must be via an approved National Research and Education Network (NREN).  This includes CENIC and Internet2, so normal UC usage meets this requirement.
