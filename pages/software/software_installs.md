## What software is installed?

There are hundreds of software tools installed on HPCC's systems. Most software
is administered under a module system. To find out what software is
installed, users want to consult the software listing 
[here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/software_modules) or run from a user account the following command.

```bash
module avail
```

More details on this is available on the HPCC manual pages [here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_start.html).

## Software install requests

Registered users can email software install requests to HPCC's issue tracking system @ [support@hpcc.ucr.edu](mailto:support@hpcc.ucr.edu). Install requests are addressed in the order received. Simple installs are addressed within 1 to a few days. Complex installs may take longer.
